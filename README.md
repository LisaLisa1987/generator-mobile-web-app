========================

This is a new fancy and awesome Yeoman Generator for web apps or other apps. 

Instead of making the same setup-stuff for your daily business, just use this generator and lean back. Use your remaining time to catch a bear or cup of coffee.


##Whats inside?

Tons of cool stuff. You can pick libraries like jQuery, jQuery mobile, Bootstrap and so on. Just select the ones you need, or use all of them!


##How to use?

Choose a command line tool of your choice and navigate via 'cd' to your desired folder:

`<addr>` cd path/to/my/folder

Then just type in:

`<addr>` yo mobile

This opens a yeoman-dialog in your console. 
Give your app a name and press 'enter'.

After that, the funny yeoman will ask you which libraries you want to use. Navigate with arrow-keys and press space-bar to select/deselect a library.

Press enter, wait a little bit and let the generator do some stuff for you.

And ... here you are! Have fun with your new (web) app.
