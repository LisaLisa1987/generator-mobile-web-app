generator-mobile-web-app
========================

This is a new fancy and awesome Yeoman Generator for web apps or other apps. 

Instead of making the same setup-stuff for your daily business, just use this generator and lean back. Use your remaining time to catch a bear or cup of coffee.


##Whats inside?

Tons of cool stuff. You can pick libraries like jQuery, jQuery mobile, Bootstrap and so on. Just select the ones you need, or use all of them!


##How to use?

First of all, do some initial stuff and install following:

1. NPM
2. Grunt
3. Bower

Use Git (you know that, bro? Of course you do! Otherwise, you would not be here. If you dont, read a tutorial ^^) and clone the repository to your folder:

`git clone git@github.com:LisaLisa1987/generator-mobile-web-app.git`

Navigate to that folder with a command line tool:

`cd path/to/my/cloned/directory`

Type in 
`npm link`

Then, your are almost finished, create a folder wherever you want (to make that clear, on your computer ;-P ), navigate with your command line tool to that folder and type in:

`yo mobile` 

This opens a yeoman-dialog in your console. 
Give your app a name and press 'enter'.

After that, the funny yeoman will ask you which libraries you want to use. Navigate with arrow-keys and press space-bar to select/deselect a library.

Press enter, wait a little bit and let the generator do some stuff for you.

And ... here you are! Have fun with your new (web) app.
